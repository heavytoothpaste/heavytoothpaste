### About Me
As of the time this is written, I’m a rising senior at West High School in Salt Lake City, Utah. I’m pretty involved in science fairs and I’m a student researcher at the University of Utah. Outside of that, I also like math (the problem solving aspect of it, at least) and I know a lot more science than the average person. Hoping to study Computational Neuroscience or something along those lines in college. I also swim (read: 1-2 practices a week D:) and like any stereotypical Chinese person, like to play Ping Pong and am good at it. I also love listening to TWICE, so if you’re reading this and also love TWICE, then shoot me a message! As you might be able to tell, I also love Calvin and Hobbes. I’ll probably be starting off every post with a comic relating to the subject at hand (the one attached to this post may seem unrelated to this but only the true fans will know!). I also love to play poker and other card games (including but not limited to Fish and Set)
